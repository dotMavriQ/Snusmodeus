# Snusmodeus

## Project Overview
Snusmodeus is a Progressive Web App (PWA) built with Next.js. It dynamically scrapes and displays data from various nicotine pouch websites, using serverless functions on Vercel and storing the data in Wasabi S3. The project aims to provide real-time updates and insights from the world of nicotine pouches, with a focus on performance and user experience.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: React, Next.js
- **Backend**: Serverless Functions on Vercel
- **Web Scraping**: Axios, Cheerio
- **Storage**: Wasabi S3
- **UI Design**: Material Design Principles

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Setup and Installation
(TODO: Instructions on setting up the project locally, including installing dependencies, environment setup, and running the development server.)

## Usage
(TODO: Instructions on how to use the app, including any available scripts and commands.)

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
